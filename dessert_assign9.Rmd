Create an R project for this assignment.

Inside this R project, place a .csv file that contains a column of your five favorite desserts, a column of the rating you’d give the dessert, and a third column containing roughly the quantity of said dessert you could eat.

Create an R Markdown file in the R project that 1) uploads the data, 2) summarizes the three columns, and 3) visually represents the data in some way.

Create your own repository of this Project on GitHub and paste a link to your repository here.

Generate a readme file to help me figure out what you’ve done :)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
dessert <- read.csv("/Users/apple/Downloads/Psy 4960 seminar/VistaNiu-R-assignment/Assign9.csv")

summary(dessert$favorite.dessert)
summary(dessert$rating.of.dessert)
summary(dessert$number.of.dessert)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dessert, aes(number.of.dessert, rating.of.dessert, color = as.factor(favorite.dessert)))+geom_point()
```
